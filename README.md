# PySuperChip
Another Super Chip Emulator

Now this is the definitive emulator to run both SCHIP and CHIP8 games. I'll leave the first one (PyChip8 in my repository) outdated but with a low count of lines of code to facilitate for anyone that want to learn.

This new one now supports Super Chip games, you can choose speed of emulation and choose plataform for better compatibility. I also implemented an anti-flickering measure.

INSTRUCTIONs: 

Put the .exe in the same directory of your ROMs and execute. The key bindings are the default used in most chip8 emulators.

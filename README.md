# PySuperChip
Another Super Chip Emulator

This is a work in progress. It runs some S-CHIP games but some are broken. I decided to release it early because it runs modern chip-8 games that have glitches on my Chip8 emulator, Pychip8, due to changes in how the CPU instructions work.

Pre-release download link: https://github.com/Zafarion/PySuperChip/releases/tag/superchip

Instructions of use: see Pychip8 repository readme.
